## What is the Neo CSS API?
The Neo CSS API is a utility library built using the SASS module system. It was created to simplify the challenge of building complex designs with a consistent style. It can be used standalone, or integrated into any CSS of your choosing!

### It provides the following benefits:
- Setup and use is easy! Simply `@use` the API once in a file, and you have access to everything!  
[Variable]({{ '/api/variables/' | url }}), [function]({{ '/api/functions/' | url }}), and [mixin]({{ '/api/mixins/' | url }}) names are smarty chosen&mdash;so they're easy to understand and remember!
- Minimal to no configuration! All variable defaults are expected and well chosen. But when it comes to customizing, you can do that easily too!
- Automatic forwarding of all SASS built-in modules. Meaning, in addition to its custom APIs&mdash;its easy to use the plethora of built-in ones too!
- Powerful design tools. Custom APIs for typography, color, padding and margins make designing interfaces easy!
- Specific APIs for irregular displays. Easily craft pages for smartwatch and "notched" displays.
